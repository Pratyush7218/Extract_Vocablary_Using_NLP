Jessica  have I come at a bad time ?      Gerald  this is Harvey Specter       He 's our best closer       Well  if you're the best closer       where the hell you been for the last three hours ?      Well  Gerald  I specialize in troubled situations       and when I left here at  PM       this deal was n't in jeopardy       so I 'm just trying to figure out what happened in the interim       We keep offering more money       They keep rejecting it       It 's lastminute bad faith bullsh        Says here that Cooper wo n't be staying on      as honorary vice president       That 's right  I do n't want him around       He would n't be around       It 's an honorary position       I do n't give a sh        Well  I think you do       because that 's what 's changed since I left       which means it 's you who 's been dealing in bad faith       Well  now that you 've got a grasp on what 's happened      in the goddamn interim       what are you gon na do about it ?      Because he 's not getting that title       Well  let me make sure I understand this  okay ?      We negotiated a deal that gave you everything you wanted       Mr Cooper signed it  and now you wo n't close      until we take away the last shred of his dignity ?      We negotiated a deal that gave you everything you wanted       Mr Cooper signed it  and now you wo n't close      and my firm does n't operate in bad faith       Oh  I see how it is       Instead of working Cooper       you 're working me       Well  why do n't you take your pansy attitude      back in there and make him sign my deal ?      Or I 'll pay someone else your money      to do it for me  First of all  Gerald       if you think anyone 's gon na touch this deal      after your bad faith  you 're mistaken       Second  the way our agreement works is       the minute Cooper signed the deal      which gave you everything you wanted       our fee was due and payable  which is why at       I received confirmation of a wire transfer      from escrow indicating payment in full       So I 'd say the ball 's in your court       but the truth is your balls are in my fist       Now I apologize if that image is too pansy for you       but I 'm comfortable enough with my manhood      to put it out there       Now get your ass in there      and close the goddamn deal       You gon na let him talk to me like this ?      Harvey speaks for the firm       We got paid before Gerald signed the deal ?      What are you talking about ? This is a memo      about some fire drill on Tuesday        Huh   You 're the Blue Team Captain       You get to wear a fire hat       Time 's up       Pencils down       Excuse me  Do I know you from somewhere ?

Actually  no  I would get a        Now can I have my money  please ?      Whoa  This is only half       Then why do n't you go call the police ?      I got to get my sh  together       That 's the best cheeseburger I 've had in my life       It 's from Monday  Trevor       Look  man  I 'm serious       I almost got caught today       I 've got to stop getting stoned       I 've got to get my act together       Dude  look at me       You can burn bud and still be a success       You sell pot for a living       Still saps the motivation       All I 'm saying is  you want in       you are in       You know  that is word for word      your offer before I got caught      cheating on your math test in the third grade       Goddamn memory       Stop       Look  no one 's gon na suspect you 're a dealer       I mean  look at me       This is a $  suit  Mike       I got  like   of 'em       I take on real software projects       I have clients who bring me briefcases filled with cash       and I hand them identical briefcases      with vacuumsealed bud       So what do you need me for ?      Well  I have a client coming in from out of town       and I ca n't meet him       and I need someone I can trust to make the drop       It 's totally safe       Trevor  a person is more likely to die      while dealing drugs than they would be      on death row in Texas       Wait  What are you talking about ?      It 's from  i  Freakonomics  i       Do you read anything that I give you ?      It does n't matter       because you have to find somebody else       I 'm not interested       Not interested in what ?      What are you doing here ? You said you were gon na stay      at your place tonight       Hi  sweetie       What a pleasant surprise       I 'm so glad you stopped by  Yeah       We 're in the middle of something       What are you in the middle of ?      Trevor 's trying to set me up       That 's terrific       Who 's the lucky girl ?      I 'm trying to get him to work for me       That 's a great idea       It will take some stress off Trevor       and you 'll pick up writing code      like you do everything else       All right  I got to go       I got go get up early to see my grandmother      and pay them another month       Oh        Good night   Bye       How did you know Gerald would n't look at that memo ?      Because a charging bull always looks at the red cape       not at the man with the sword       By the way  I 've set up a meeting      for you and John Dockery next week       Dockery ? He 's Skadden 's biggest client       Not anymore       He 's looking around       He plays tennis  I want you to close him       Consider it done       Then you are officially dismissed      for the evening       Cheers       Well  you two seem to be celebrating something       Mmhmm  We are       In fact  you are looking      at the best closer this city has ever seen       Closer  huh ?      Baseball ? Attorney       I close situations       Hmm  So you only care about money ?      The truth is  I do it for the children       I 'm Lisa       Harvey       Lisa  I do n't normally do this       but since we are celebrating       what time do you get off tonight ?      I 'm glad you asked       I get off at ten past I 'm never going out with you       I guess you 're not the best closer this city 's ever seen              Good morning       Lisa  this was lovely       but I 'm afraid you have to go        Aw   I hate to miss a workout       and I really need to be in the office by        Ca n't we have breakfast ?      You could eat it off my stomach       I guess if I skip the gym       I can still get in by        I hear someone's not taking their pills       Because they 're trying to poison me       Grammy  that 's crazy       Dr shrager gave me her word      she would n't poison you until January       If she does it before then  she ca n't count it      towards next year 's quota       Oh  what did I teach you ?      Michael  I 'm not gon na be around forever       And I want you to stop with that stuff       What stuff ?      I may be old       but I 'm not an idiot       I know life has been hard for you       but you 're not a kid anymore       and I want you to promise      you 're gon na start living up to your potential       I promise       I 'm not saying that I haven't been charmed by Harvey       but it 's just so patronizing      when you say that he can handle those things      and   Louis  you can only handle this  ''      Jessica  I could have handled Gerald Tate       And I told you I disagree        Why ?  Because when you put      two bullies in the same room together       things generally do n't go so well       It 's   Nice of you to show up      two hours after we open for business       And I see that you 're also trying to look like a pimp       My bad  Louis  I was out late last night       And when I woke up  this is the suit      your wife picked out for me       And that would be funny      if I 'd actually been married  Moving along        You 're not married ?  Recruiting  Harvey       Your interviews are set up for tomorrow       What ? Why do n't we just hire      the Harvard summer associate douche ?      I think if you listen to the phrasing      of that question  you 'll come up with an answer       We need people who think on their feet       not another clone with a rod up his ass       Harvey  the fact that we only hire from Harvard      gives us a cache that 's a little more valuable      than hiring a kid from Rutgers       You went to Harvard law       I 'm an exception       Find me another one       Can we please skip the recruiting ?      I work better alone anyway       Well  I would  Harvey       except all senior partners get an associate       It 's just a rule       I 'm sorry  What ?      Jessica  I deserve that promotion       My billables destroy his       And I 'm here night and day doing whatever 's needed      instead of swanning in and out of here      whenever I please       I must admit  he does make me sound very swanlike       Harvey       shut up       Louis  this is how it is       All right  now you two make nice       Louis  I apologize  I was out of line       Now if you 'll just let me text your pretend wife      that I just made senior partner  I  what ?      Your grandmother's getting worse       I need to move her to full care      or I 'll have to transfer her to the state facility       I wo n't put her in a state facility       Then I 'm afraid you 'll have to come up with $        Trevor  I 'm in       Onetime deal  I want        Take it or leave it       I 'll take it       There 's a briefcase in my room       Pick it up tomorrow       take it to room       at the Chilton Hotel       Now you ca n't go to a luxury hotel      looking like a delivery guy  so shave       comb your hair  buy a suit       That 's a hell of a lot to ask  man       Well  I 'm not asking you  I 'm paying you $        Okay ?

Same reason why I do n't tell Gina      I 'm banging her sister       It 'll only cause trouble       What 's up ?      I 'm just gon na take off       I do n't think you should       Why do n't you stay with us till tomorrow ?

I like to read       And why 'd you ask them what time it was ?      Throw 'em off       What kind of drug dealer      asks a cop what time it is      when he 's got a briefcase full of pot  right ?      We should hire you       Jesus  I 'd give you the  grand      as a signing bonus       I 'll take it       Unfortunately       we only hire from Harvard       And you not only did not go to Harvard law school       you have n't even gone to any law school       What if I told you that I consume knowledge      like no one you 've ever met       and I 've actually passed the bar ?      I 'd say you 're full of crap       That 's a barbri legal handbook right there  right ?      Open it up  Read me something       Anything       Civil liability associatednwith agency is basednnn   non several factors  Including the deviationnnn   nof the agent from his path       the reasonable inferencenof agency on behalfnnn   nof the plaintiff  and the nature      of the damages themselves  ''      How did you know that ?      I learned it when I studied for the bar       Okay  hotshot       fire up this laptop       I 'm gon na show you      what a Harvard attorney can do       Pick a topic       Stock option backdating       Although backdating options is legal       violations arise related to disclosures      under IRC section A       You forgot about sarbanesoxley       The statute of limitations      renders sarbanesoxley moot post        Not if you can find actions      to cover up the violation      as established in the sixth circuit  may        That 's impressive  but you're sitting at a computer       Playing hearts       Sorry  If you want to beat me       you 're gon na have to do it at something else       How can you know all that ?      I told you  I like to read       And once I read something  I understand it       And once I understand it  I never forget it       Why take the bar ?      This dickhead bet me I could n't pass it      without going to law school       Okay  look       this is all pretty fascinating stuff       but I 'm afraid I got to get back to work       I 'll make sure that serpico is n't around      waiting for you       You want this job so much       why did n't you just go to law school ?      When I was in college       it was my dream to be a lawyer       I needed some money       and Trevor convinced me      to memorize this math test      and to sell it       Turns out we sold it to the Dean 's daughter       I lost my scholarship  I got kicked out of school       I       I got knocked into a different life       And I have been wishing for a way back ever since       Let me tell you something       This is n't elementary school  This is hard work       Long hours  High pressure       I need a grown goddamn man       You give me this       and I will work as hard as it takes      to school those Harvard douches      and become the best lawyer you have ever seen       I 'm inclined to give you a shot       but what if I decide to go another way ?      I 'd say that 's fair       Sometimes I like to hang out with people      who are n't that bright  you know       just to see how the other half lives       Move over       I 'm emailing the firm I just found our next associate       All right  You 're gon na start a week      from Monday       Here 's what you 're gon na do       First  no more pot  We drug test       Stop smoking now  you 'll be fine       I assume that 's all the drugs you do        How do you know that ?

People are in awe of him       They say he 's the best closer there is       but I have very little contact with him       so I do n't know       And what about Louis Litt ?      Let 's continue with your tour       Hey  Becky  You are glowing       I wonder why that is  Oh  yeah       It 's the day they announce my promotion       Jimmy  have you lost weight ?      SteveO       Looking like a guy who came to work       Excuse me  why are you scratching off      the senior off my door ?      I got a work order to take it off        Who issued the work order ?  My supervisor       Why did he issue the work order ?      If I knew that  I 'd be his supervisor       You seem to be enjoying yourself       I have n't enjoyed myself since        Donna !      Someone 's trying to have a little fun with me here       Jessica wants to see you in her office       Now       And finally  this is where you 'll live       Wow       I gave you that for a reason  You have n't taken one note        That 's because   Because you were      too busy ogling me to listen      to a word I 've said ?      Partners ' offices anchor the wings       Fifth floor 's research  sixth is security       All work gets billed  even if it 's finding an address       I answer to Harvey      and Louis Litt  and  judging by the way      you responded to my questions       I should admire Harvey and I should fear Louis       You have been here for five years       and just because I outrank you      does not mean I have the authority      to command your services       Oh  it 's also pretty clear      that you think you 're too smart      to be a paralegal       You know what nobody likes ?      Nobody likes a showoff       You used the word  ogling  ''      When do I get to see Harvey ?      Gerald Tate fired the firm       So you 're taking my promotion away       You know  most firms would put you in front of the bar      and have your license stripped       You lied to a client  and he figured it out       I lied to him to get him to do the right thing      and honor his goddamn contract       And you did n't seem to mind so much      when you thought I got away with it       But you did n't get away with it       And I ca n't justify handing you a promotion      on the same day that you lose a huge client       One client does n't make a firm       I do n't know if you 've noticed       but we 're in the middle of an economic meltdown       Companies are n't exactly lining up      to spend money on attorneys right now       And  you know  Gerald might have forgiven the lying      had you not humiliated him       But you did  and you need to accept that       Jessica  if you had n't done as much for me as you have       I 'd be heading for the door       If I had n't done as much for you as I have       I 'd be throwing you out the window       But  Harvey  no more shenanigans       You do one more thing that is n't straight as an arrow       and instead of covering your ass       I will put you in front of the bar myself        Mike   Hey       Who 's ready for a great first day ?      I 'm gon na have to let you go        What ?  I just got reamed      for lying to a client       and if they find out that I lied about you      going to Harvard  they 'll take away my license       You what ?      Not now  Donna       Look  I have to put my own interests      above yours  It 's nothing personal       You 're fired       Wait  so you 're worried that if I stay       then they might find out that you lied about me      and you 'll lose your license       But if you fire me  then I could tell them      that you lied about me       and you 'd definitely lose your license       Are you telling me that      if I throw you under the bus       you 're gon na drag me with you ?      You put your interests above mine       and I 'm just putting mine back up next to yours       You 're rehired       So should I  all right       Here 's what 's gon na happen  You 're gon na give me back      my promotion  and that 's the last      we 're gon na talk about this       And why is that ?      Because if you do n't  I 'm gon na go across town      and join Rick Peterson       I 'm gon na approach every client I 've ever closed       and I 'm gon na take them with me       You do that  and you 'll force me      to put you in front of the ethics board        I do n't think you will   And why not ?      Because you were obligated to notify them      the second I lied to Gerald  but you did n't       You put me in front of the board right now       I 'll put you right up there with me       Hmm       I 'll  I 'll give you your promotion       But you have to do something for me       Anything       Ah  Pro Bono       Anything but that       Harvey  Pro Bono cases      are how we  as a firm  show that we care      about more than just ourselves       I 'm not saying we should n't do them       I 'm saying I should n't do them       And it 's how you can show me      that you care about more than just yourself       You 'll handle this yourself       You will not pass it off       Absolutely       Your first case       Awesome  What is it ?      Pro Bono       Sexual harassment       Do n't tell anyone I laid it off on you       and do n't screw it up  Got it       You ca n't handle it  I 'll knock it out of the park       Easy  Clarence Thomas  Just go meet the client       Hey  Did n't I tell you to get some better suits ?      I spent $        For how many suits ?      Five       What ?      Nancy ?       Mike ?  Yeah  hi       You 're a kid       No  I 'm a  I 'm a grown man       You 're so skinny  Have a grape       Thank you       Why do n't you tell me your story ?      It started two years ago       I was a stayathome mom      to my son  Freddie       And one day we were at little league       Freddie was five       He really hated that he could n't play      with the older kids       It was the third inning  and I got a phone call       My husband had been in a car accident       and he was gone  just like that       I 'm so sorry       I did the best I could       I got myself a job as a secretary      at Devlin McGreggor       And I even got promoted      to secretary of the president       Charles Hunt       And that 's when it all changed       It 's okay  Tell me what happened       He started asking me to stay late       order in dinners together  stuff like that       One night  he says that if I sleep with him       he 's gon na take care of me in the firm       and  if I do n't  he 's gon na fire me       So what did you do ?      I went to human resources       They said they investigated       could n't find anything to support my claim       Two months later  I was fired      for poor job performance       They would n't let me say goodbye to anybody       They would n't write me a letter of recommendation       I was n't looking for a payoff       All I wanted was for it to stop       Can you help me ?      Uh  yes       Yes  I can       What do you need my help for ?       Wait  can I just   No  give me the update       You know  she 's a nice woman       She  On the case       I do n't get emotionally attached      to the client       This woman had her life ripped apart       You do n't even care ?      I 'm not about caring  I 'm about winning       Why ca n't you be about both ?      I 'd explain it to you       but then I 'd have to care about you       What are you doing ?      Do n't touch that       I 'm just checking my lock       You ride your bike to       It 's locked  okay ?      Come on       Defense sent over the investigation files      as a courtesy  No  they did n't       Nobody does anything as a courtesy       They sent those files      because that's where they want you to look       Listen  being a lawyer's      like being a doctor       You mean how you do n't get emotional about the client ?      No  I mean you keep pressing until it hurts       Then you know where to look       Forget about impeaching the investigation       It wo n't lead anywhere  No employee 's gon na testify      against their own CEO  Okay       So what do you suggest I do ?      Think  This guy 's done this once       He 's done it before       And if the people who work for him now      wo n't testify against him       Someone who used to work for him might       You know what       I 'd subpoena the personnel records      of every woman who 's left the firm      during this guy 's tenure  That 's funny       That 's exactly what I thought       Then what do you need my help for ?      I do n't know how to fill out a subpoena       Figure it out yourself       Donna  can you show me how to fill out a subpoena ?      Absolutely  And after that       you want me to show you how to wipe your ass ?      It 's funny  because you should already know      how to do both those things       Ha  yeah  that 's hilarious       What 's that ? That 's my suit guy       Go in  tell him I sent you  and spend some money       What does it matter how much money I spend on suits ?      People respond to how we 're dressed       so like it or not  this is what you have to do       That 's weird  you giving me advice       It sounds like you actually care about me       I do n't  You 're a reflection of me       and I absolutely care about me       So get your skinny tie out of my face and get to work       That was a little harsh       Really ?      Yeah       Mike       Where are you going ?      It 's   I 'm going home       Okay  What 's so funny ?      You 're a rookie associate       If you go home before  on your first week       you 're not gon na make it through your first month       And Louis Litt wants to see you        Hey  can I ask you something ?  Mmhmm       This tie  is it too skinny ?      Yeah       Right       Yeah       I know you had orientation from Rachel       but I wanted to give you a special welcome from me       Amongst other things  I 'm sort of the disciplinarian      of the associates        You wanted to see me ?  Yes       Gary  please come in  Mike  this is Gary Lipsky       Gary 's one of our most promising associates from last year       Hi       Gary  Ms Pearson wanted me to ask       have you completed the petramco filing ?      Well  my brother was in over the weekend       so I did n't really get to it       Look  I mean  Gary  come on       This is  like  the third time I 've had to ask       I 'll get right on it       Do n't bother  You 're fired       What ? You ca n't fire me       Oh  yes  I can  And I just did       Go pack up your things       Do n't you ever show your face in this place again       See  I arranged for you to see that      because we pay our associates very well      and we provide the opportunity for unlimited advancement       But in return we expect results       Have I made myself clear ?      Yeah       Great       Welcome to Pearson Hardman       Feel free to go back to work       Harvey       Okay  I have two words for you       Absolutely beautiful       You think you 're the only one who can charm a client ?

Watching  i  sportscenter  i       Booyah       You wo n't return my phone calls       Ah  yeah  because you set me up       Do you remember that ? You think I knew about that ?      Here we go  Round  of I get the shaft      because you did n't know the whole story       You knew there were risks when you quoted that crap      from that book       Okay  you needed money       and I came through with an opportunity      like always       Besides  you weren't the only one who got screwed       They pulled a gun on me       Oh  really ?      And why did they do that ?      To keep me from warning you       So you did know       Well  not until after it was too late       Well  it 's too late now       Look  let me make it up to you       Oh  you want to make it up to me ?      Give me my key back       Michael       Come on       You know I do n't want to live in a world      where we 're not tight       Then kill yourself       Get out       Get the hell out       Donna  I need the       oh  also I did n't have a chance to       marry me ?  I took care of that too       We 've been married for the last seven years       Excellent       Umm  Devlin McGreggor's fighting the subpoena       They filed a motion to dismiss the case      based on our lack of evidence        Good   Good       Wait  what do you mean   good '' ?      They do n't want to hand over the files       You pressed where it hurt       You 're looking in the right place       Did you think they would n't fight back ?      Well  I  now that you mention it       Oh  my bad       I keep forgetting      you don't actually know anything        The idea is       you make a move  they make a move       You go back and forth until one of you wins       Okay  what if they win the motion      and the case gets dismissed ?      You 're not as good as you think you are       Harvey  What a coincidence       I was wondering how the Pro Bono was coming       I 'm all over it       That makes me very happy       because if I were to find out      that you were n't putting in your full effort       I 'd be very upset       No worries  We 're all good       Rachel ! Rachel  Rachel  Rachel  I need your help       There 's a hearing on my subpoena       I 've got three cases in front of you       so you 're gon na have to wait in line       No  No  no  no       My hearing is tomorrow       So why are you coming to me ?      Because Donna says      you 're the best researcher in the firm       Let me see the motion       Whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa       You have an office ?      How do you have an office and I have a cubicle ?      Like you said  I 'm the best researcher      in the firm  Really ?      I just made that up       I did n't even have time to talk to Donna       Is this all a joke to you ?      'Cause I take my job seriously       No  I 'm sorry       Look  I was       look  you were n't there  okay       I care about this woman       She 's got nowhere else to turn        and you ca n't help her by yourself       I can       I just prefer not to       Okay       You 're asking to look at private files      without any evidence of your assertion       Yeah  but the only way that we can find      the evidence is to look at those files       It 's a rickety argument       But is there a precedent ?      Let 's go see if we can find one       Research is as much art as science       so we 're gon na look at privacy and harassment law      so you can find a combination of cases      to make an argument  I 'll take privacy       I 'll take harassment law       This 'll take a while       We 're gon na need dinner        Chinese   No       I can afford Chinese on my own       This is on the firm  I want sushi       Ooh       So they told me to put my top investigator on it        What did you do ?  What could I do ?      You were out of the country  I gave them Luderman       By the way  that dress       What  this old thing ? Come on       Beautiful       Vanessa  why do n't we do this more often ?      'Cause it always ends the same way       Then why are we doing it now ?      Harvey  I do n't sleep around       And I could never be in a relationship with you       All you ever think about is yourself       I 'm thinking about you and me right now       Please  I insist       But I 'm a gentleman       Besides  you came through      on Dockery for me  and I 'm not one      to forget a favor       Neither am I       Mr Dockery  you naughty  naughty boy       You remember when I said you thought you were too smart      to be a paralegal ? Mmhmm        Why   Are n't I a lawyer ?      Mm       I do n't test well  What ?      I am smart       And I know I 'd be a good lawyer       I just  I do n't know what it is       I ca n't take tests       and I bombed the lsats       And even if I could get      into law school  there 's no way      I 'd pass the bar       So if only there was someone who could take the test for me        Yeah  if only there were   Yeah       Hi  Where are you at with the research      for tomorrow 's hearing ? Nothing yet       You say you care about the client       but if you keep playing footsie      instead of finding me an argument       the client 's gon na lose       I do n't want to lose       Ugh       Look  it 's no use       Okay  their investigation's by the book       We look like the bad guys coming in       putting them under duress       What did you just say ?      I said we look like the bad guys       No  you said      they did it by the book      and we 're putting them under duress       Yeah        Look   Hmm       This is good  We 're gon na have some fun       We ? I get to go ?      You did n't think I 'd let you come along ?       No   Good instinct  I was n't       But then I thought it 'd be cruel      not to let you witness my greatness        Okay  can I go get my bag ?  No        You 're a true giver   Other side       Okay       Your honor  this case should be thrown out       Other than her story  the plaintiff does n't have      one piece of evidence       Because the evidence lies within their personnel files       which they 're conveniently refusing to hand over       Those files contain sensitive information       He 's fishing at the expense      of our employees ' right to privacy       Please  They do n't give a rat 's ass      about his employees ' right to privacy       Sorry  that 's actually unfair to rats ' asses       Your honor  Mr Specter's claim that we do n't care      about our employees  though belittling       does n't carry any weight as a rule of law       True  but what does carry weight is that an investigation      of sexual harassment must be conducted      without any duress       Your point ?      The investigator and every person      being interviewed answers to the ceo      they 're investigating       That is the definition of duress       It 'd be as if your bailiff      accused you of sexual harassment      and you assigned your stenographer      to investigate       Now how likely would it be      that this investigation yielded any fruit ?      You honestly think I would harass Herman ?      Well  I do n't know  your honor       Some people have a thing for the uniform       Ugh  I 'd like to think Herman would come to me      before it even got to an investigation       I saw that  That should be stricken       But what if Herman did come to you  your honor ?      And you betrayed his trust      by firing him under false pretenses ?      You really think that little of me ?      I would n't trust you as far as I could throw you       Your honor       Hand over the files        Oh   Today       That 's it       Herman  I 'd like to speak to you in chambers       That was awesome       It was your argument       I just framed it in a way      that humanized the situation      and brightened all of our afternoons       I feel like Michael corleone in that scene      where that fat guy teaches him how to shoot that gun       Are you saying that I 'm the fat guy ?      'Cause I 'm not the fat guy       Mm       You know what his name was ?       Yeah   Cordoza        Clemenza   I knew that       I was just testing to see if you knew it       I knew that you knew that I knew              Train wreck       Hey  I 'm looking      for rene       I 'm rene  I 'm sorry       We do n't sell skinny jeans at this location       Did Harvey tell you I was coming  or  ?      Harvey Specter sent you ?      That 's another story       Do you know your inseam ?      I do n't  It 's probably a medium       Oh  Why do n't you browse for a while ?      These are the most exclusive       and we move down in price      as you head to the door       Oh  Okay       Large ?      That 's not how it works       Huh       So Trevor 's getting you to do his dirty work for him  huh ?      All I know is you are n't talking to each other       I miss you       I want things      to go back to the way they were       I miss you too  But       I 'm not sure things are ever going back      to the way they were       I got ta go       What did he say ?      He said things are n't ever going back      to the way they were       What did you do ?      I do n't know       Hey       So the files are on their way       We won ?      That 's fantastic       So now we have a week      to corroborate Nancy 's story       Listen  I could n't have done it without you       You would n't even know where to look without me       You know what nobody likes ?      Nobody likes a showoff       Hello       Yeah  he 's here       Okay  Thank you       Files are in conference room C      Why would n't they bring them to my cubicle ?      They 're trying to bury you in paperwork       Well  they picked the wrong guy       If they did n't  I did       Get it done by the end of the week       I got to run and charm our new client       Nice to finally meet you       Jessica says you're gon na sweep me off my feet       I 'll do my best  Mr Dockery       You got a nice serve there       Working on it       What the hell is this ?      It 's you having sex with a woman      who is n't Mrs Dockery       Are you trying to blackmail me ?      You asked my firm where you 're vulnerable      to corporate takeover       That 's it right there       What are you pulling here ?      Your wife owns  %      of the company 's voting shares       You 've been seeing this woman and several others      for quite some time       How do you think your wife 's gon na vote      after she finds out ? Who says she has to find out ?      My investigator got these within a week       What do you think a motivated competitor's      gon na dig up in a year ?      I have a solution       Trade her your preferred shares       which have no voting rights       for her common shares  which do       The preferred shares are worth $  million more       A fraction of what you 'll lose      if you get voted out of your company       John  I do n't care if you sleep      with every woman in the Hamptons       Just give her the preferred shares       Jessica said you were gon na charm me to get my business       I 'm not interested in getting your business       I 'm interested in keeping it       I know where they do n't want us to look       Did you get through all those files in one night ?      I would have done it faster       but I ordered a pizza       Speaking of which  have you ever had      the cheese in the crust ?      Because it blew my mind  What 'd you find ?      There was a dismissal on march th         But the file with the employee name on it is missing       It 's our woman  I know it is       I 'm moving to slap sanctions      on their attorney  possible jail time       Guy 's not gon na know what hit him       Dennis  it 's Harvey Specter       Did you have anything to do with the march    files      left out of discovery ?      If they 're here by noon  I 'll believe you       If not  we 're filing for sanctions       Threat of sanctions is better than filing for sanctions       That 's what I meant  Threaten  not file       Who would mean that ?      Shave       Have you ever heard of this woman ?      Joanna Webster ?      No  Why ?      The company 's trying to hide her from us       You think Hunt did the same thing to her      that he did to me ? Yes       Then you have to make her come forward and say so       Yeah  That 's the plan       Thank you       Joanna Webster ?      Can I help you ?      Hi  My name 's Mike Ross       I 'm a  I 'm a lawyer       I have some questions for you      about your time at Devlin McGreggor       Please  Look  just let me tell you a story      about my client  okay ?      Fine  Just a second       Mr Ross       what happened to me happened six years ago       It was horrible       and there was a reason I did n't do anything      about it       They 'll put me on that stand      and attack me  and I do n't want that       Ms Webster  Joanna       this man is a predator       and if you do n't help stop him  he will do it again       All you have to do is give a deposition       I 'm sorry       I ca n't do it       What happened with the witness ?      Uh  I failed       To not be awesome       I got her to testify !      You should have seen me  I tried everything       He 'd do it again       I 'd be with her every step of the way       Nothing worked       And then it hit me       I asked her what if it was her daughter      that he did this to       She melted       And you know how I came up with that little gem ?      I cared about her  Oh       Yeah       Thank you       I 'm glad to see that staying up all night      does n't make you act like a complete idiot       Go home and get some sleep       I do n't want you waving that thing around      during tomorrow 's deposition       Harvey       How 's the pro Bono going ?      Great  I just talked a witness into testifying       Really ? What 's the witness 's name ?      I 'm not an idiot       Do n't treat me like one       You pawned off the case       Jessica  I 've got higher profile cases       Need I remind you that when we first met       you were a screwup ?      I gave you a shot at the mail room       led you up the ranks  and then paid for you to go to Harvard       where  by the way  you jerked off the entire time      you were there  and I still hired you       And you 've benefited from that ever since       Look  I closed the Dockery case  okay       You made a promise to me       You broke it  and then you lied to my face       So let me be clear  This is n't professional       This is personal       And I 'll tell you something else       You made your bed  you better goddamn win       God damn it       What the hell is wrong with you ? I need the briefcase back       Oh  so that 's what this has been about  huh ?      You do n't care about our friendship at all       You 're my oldest friend  and you know it       But you do n't seem to care about that anymore       and  yeah  I need the briefcase back       And I 'm gon na find it  Mike       Well  I ditched it when I was running away      from the cops that you sent me into       Mike       Where you going ?      To my cubicle       No  you 're not  It 's pee in a cup time       I 'm sorry  What ?      Drug test  Follow me       I 'm just gon na put my stuff back       now       Oh  by the way  my cousin was your year at Harvard       And I asked him if he knew you       It 's so funny  He did n't       Well  what 's his name ?      Mitch samberg       Yeah  Do n't know him       It 's a big school       Not really       We get  applications a year       You think you can just walk in and take a tour ?      Oh  Mitchell       With the slicked back hair       graduated seventh in the class       Sure  Yeah  I remember him       Time to face the music       I got to get to the Kendrick filing       Where the hell is Mike ?      I do n't know       Leave the cup on the counter       You 'll have to leave that out here        Why ?  If you take it in there      with you  I have to check to make sure you do n't have      another urine sample in it        Where you been ?  Hi  Um       Getting drug tested  actually       The deposition's this afternoon       Before they get here  I want you to grill this woman      about her background for anything they might use      against her       You got it ? Got it        Make her tell you everything   Everything        Everything   Everything        Okay   Okay       I had been working six months      when Mr Hunt started asking me to work more       order dinner       One night  late  he tried to have sex with me       The next day  I requested a change in assignment       Two months later I was fired for having a bad attitude       This is ridiculous       Wipe that smirk off your face       You 're not even supposed to be here       Mr Hunt has every right to be here       Now  Ms Webster  after working for Devlin McGreggor       you then went on to waitress at Hooters  right ?       Yes  I did   A place that advertises      the sexuality of its waitstaff  correct ?      You will have to ask them that       I 'm asking you       And she 's not answering  Move on       Ms Webster  would you say that you 're a truthful person ?      Yes       So when you said earlier that you had never been arrested      for a crime  you were speaking the truth ?       Yes   Yes  so in  then      you were not arrested for stealing $  worth of jewelry      from the willow grove mall in Pennsylvania ?      I was   That was one mistake       Those records were supposed to be sealed       So when you say those records were sealed       what you mean to say is you thought      you could get away with a lie ?      No  that 's not it       You 're making it seem different that it is       I 'm sorry  You were arrested in your past      and you lied about it here under oath       Is that making it seem different      than what it is ?      No answer  Hmm  all right       Let me ask you this  since you 've lied here once       what 's to make us believe you 're not lying about Mr Hunt ?      How the hell did you miss that arrest ?      I did every background check we have       Did you grill her like I told you to ?      It was a sealed record  Harvey !      Goddamn it  I knew it       Fix it       Joanna ! Wait  Please !      This is why I did n't want to testify       They twist something from  years ago      and make me look like a liar       They make it sound like what he did      to me did n't happen       It does n't matter  All right ?      I just  I need you to testify on Friday      and keep this case alive       We do n't have time to find anyone else before       would you please wait ?      No  I 'm not waiting       You promised this would n't happen  and it did       You never told me you were arrested       Do n't contact me again  please       What happened with the witness ?      Nothing  Nothing happened  I could n't fix it       So you 're going to quit ?      It 's either that or have Louis Litt fire me       What are you talking about ?      My first day  Louis fired Gary Lipsky      for screwing up a case       He said if I did the same thing      I 'd be gone just as fast       Well  you go back to the witness ' house      and you get her to testify again        I tried  There 's no way   There 's always a way       Then why do n't you go and convince her ?      Because you screwed it up       Oh  and you do n't give a damn about the client  Right        That 's not my job   Does your job      include giving a damn about me ?      Because the least you could do is offer      to stand up to Louis for me  Stand up for you ?      I put my ass on the line for you       but it turns out you may have had the balls      to get this job  but you do n't have the courage      to stick it out when it gets tough        That 's not true   Is n't it ?      You 've had one foot out the door      since you got here  What are you talking about ?      I 'm talking about that briefcase      being locked in your desk  Yeah  I saw it       And I know what it is       It 's your backup plan in case this does n't work out       You can make some quick cash and go right back      to the life you told me you did n't want to lead       So if you want to quit  go ahead       But this is n't because of Louis  and it is n't because of me       It 's because you 're afraid you might have to admit      that you 're not as smart as you think you are       If you 're here in the morning       I 'll know I still have an associate       Hey  I get that you were upset      that I was promoted before you       but if you ever threaten to fire one of my guys again       I am going to kick your ass       Hmm  What are you talking about ?      Do n't play dumb with me  all right ?      You fired Gary Lipsky in front of Mike Ross       What 's so funny ?      Gary Lipsky works in the mail room        What ?  I did n't fire anyone       That 's how I let the new associates know      what 's expected of them       You plant a fake employee to manipulate the assoc       that 's it       What ?      Michael       I want to quit       Come here       When your parents died       I lost my son and my daughterinlaw       I was scared  alone  and I was too old to raise you       But I had no choice       Because who else was going to care of my grandson ?      You made me a promise before       You 're in the door       Promise me now the only way you 'll leave      is if they rip you out       You can save your breath       There 's no way I 'm testifying      at the hearing tomorrow       That 's not why I 'm here       I know what you did  What are you talking about ?      You never worked for Devlin McGreggor       and you were never harassed by Mr Hunt        That 's a l   Now I could tell you      that I 've got the canceled checks or the wire transfer      or whatever smoking gun that exists  I do n't       But I will  And when I do       you 'll be going to jail unless you tell me      what happened right now       I 'm the guy you tell       All I had to do was waste your time until tomorrow      after the hearing       Please  I just needed the money       I do n't want to go to jail       Here 's what you 're gon na do       Did you call this place before ?      Mike !       Hey   I 'm not giving this to you      because you need it       I 'm giving it to you because I do n't       And I do n't know if I 'm ready to forgive you yet or not       but I do know we 're even       Wait a second       I       Well       Do n't       Now we 're even       Huh       I see you came to work today  Nice suit       It was a barter transaction       I got six of them for one little briefcase       Listen       I 'm sorry and       Forget it       When I first started  Jessica rode me so hard       I quit once a month       I just told you what you needed to hear       That 's just it  I 've only ever had one person      who told me what I needed to hear       Maybe it 's time I started trusting somebody else       Merry Christmas       Is this for real ?      You know what to do       Press until it hurts       Wire transfer from your account to Joanna Webster 's       phone records with Joanna Webster      prior to her testimony       and an affidavit stating you paid Ms Webster      to falsely testify       Mr Hunt  harassment is a civil violation       The penalty is money       But witness tampering  that 's a crime       and you will go to prison       where I guarantee you 'll learn      more about unwanted sexual advances      than you can possibly imagine       Do you think this is going to intimidate me ?      Even if this evidence was credible       who are you going to get to prosecute      a smalltime witness tampering charge  huh ?      Harvey  did n't you graduate law school      with the current US attorney in New York ?      In fact  I did       And I think he might even be interested      in pursuing a case like this       Wait  are you two still close ?      Well  I was the best man at his wedding        Wow   No  you were n't       You 're bluffing       No       I think I 've got some pictures       Of us at the ceremony       Let 's see       Yeah  Here we are       You must admit  I look very dashing       This is me and his mother       The woman adores me       Here we are at his bachelor party       There 's no strippers  It was lame       But he ca n't put guys like you away for sexual harassment      and then go to strip clubs  now  can he ?      All right  What do you want ?      An admission of guilt and a guarantee      that you 'll obtain treatment before working again       And Nancy gets reinstated with back pay        Fine   And a raise       Okay  All right       Are we done ?      The kid should be able to grow up without the burden      of tuition hanging over his head  do n't you think ?      Which is why you 're also gon na pay Nancy      an extra $        Charles       Gentlemen       Thank you for everything       You 're welcome       So just one question       Why 'd you go to Joanna 's house ?      Because I figured it out       I object       I think you did it because you care       I did it because it 's my job       Would you admit it ? You care about me       I saw you smile when I showed up for work this morning       I did n't smile  I was thinking of a funny joke       Look  we start on this tomorrow       Does this mean we 're officially a team now ?      I would n't move your things into Wayne manor just yet        So now you 're Batman ?  Closer to him than Clemenza        Oh  yeah  kilmer   Clooney       Keaton       Did you really quit when you first started ?
